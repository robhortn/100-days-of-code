# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2017
**Today's Progress**: Initialized base project with a javascript starter kit.

**Thoughts:** This is my first time doing 100 days of code.  Bit of a scary thing really, putting myself out there and taking a public challenge.  Still I think that doing Burgundy in 100 days will be pretty cool.
